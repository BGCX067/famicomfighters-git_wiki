=== Gameplay Overview ===
Mario is an all around reliable character. He's easy to use but doesn't have any real advanced techniques about it. He has good reaching normals, straight forward specials and his only real weakness is his vulnerability on wakeup.

=== Specials ===

|| *Fireball*||

||Normal||QCF + A||
||EX||QCF + A + C|| 

 * Bouncing projectile with long life that can be done in air.
 * EX version sends out a fast-moving fireball that hits 4 times.

|| *Raccoon Tail*||

||Normal||QCB + B||
||EX||QCB + B + C|| 

 * Spinning attack that covers a distance while hitting multiple times.
 * EX version hits more times and has some invincibility at the start, but stays in place.

|| *Stomp*||

||Normal||DP + B||
||EX||DP + B + C|| 

||Jugem Cloud||<||<||

 * Leaping attack, lands on opponent's head dealing damage. Good when you need to distance yourself from your opponent in a sticky situation.
 * Jugem Cloud allows you to retreat or fake out your opponent. Can only be done when ascending with Stomp.
 * EX version is quicker and more powerful. It also has some invincibility at the beginning. However, you can't use the Jugem Cloud during this.

=== Supers ===

|| *Super Fire*||

||Command||QCFx2 + A||

 * Super projectile that hits twice and can be used in the air. Very useful for long-range punishes and ending air combos.

|| *Hammer Wreck*||

||Command||QCBx2 + B||

 * Compared to Super Fire, it's much stronger so it works better as a combo ender on the ground or as a ground punish. Due to the use of a weapon it has some rather high priority. Unlike the Super Fire, this move is really easy to punish on block and whiff.

|| *Multistomp*||

||Command||A + B after Stomp hitting||

 * Mario's most powerful super but to activate it, it requires a successful Stomp hit.

|| *HYPER: Ultimate POWer*||

||Command||QCF, HCB + A + B||

 * Needs to be close when activated but it can also be used as an anti-air super. It also combos almost any basic attack. On block or whiff, this move is pretty unsafe.
