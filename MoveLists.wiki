=== Gameplay Overview ===
Mario is an all around reliable character. He's easy to use but doesn't have any real advanced techniques about it. He has good reaching normals, straight forward specials and his only real weakness is his vulnerability on wakeup.

=== Specials ===

|| *Stomp*||

||Normal||DP + A||
||EX||DP + A + C|| 

||Jugem Cloud||<||<||

 * Leaping attack, lands on opponent's head dealing damage. Good when you need to distance yourself from your opponent in a sticky situation.
 * Jugem Cloud allows you to retreat or fake out your opponent. Can only be done when ascending with Stomp.
 * EX version is quicker and more powerful. It also has some invincibility at the beginning. However, you can't use the Jugem Cloud during this.
